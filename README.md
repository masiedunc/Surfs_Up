# Surfs_Up
## Project Overview
Wanting to invest in an ice cream surf shop in Hawaii, W. Avy requested an analysis of the weather statistics for the island of Oahu during the months of June and December 2010-2017. This analysis is to support W Avy’s decision to open the shop or not depending on the weather results. Better weather means better business. For this analysis SQL specifically, SQLite and SQLalchemy, and Python were tools for finding and analyzing Hawaii weather statistics. 

## Results
Reviewing the temperature summary statistics (Image 1) for June and December between 2010 and 2017, our findings show similar data. However, if we take a closer look, we can see some key differences that may affect the opening of the ice cream and surf shop. 
-	Comparing the average (mean) temperatures between June and December, findings show that December’s average is cooler than June’s. The average temperature for June is about 75 degrees, while December drops to about 71 degrees. 
-	If we focus on the maximum temperatures, the max for June was 85 degrees whereas December was 83 degrees. The difference is comparable to the difference between the averages. 
-	However, shifting the focus to the minimum temperatures, findings show a more significant difference. Where June’s lowest temperature is 64 degrees, December is 8 degrees lower than that at 56 degrees.
