# Surfs_Up
## Project Overview
Wanting to invest in an ice cream surf shop in Hawaii, W. Avy requested an analysis of the weather statistics for the island of Oahu during the months of June and December 2010-2017. This analysis is to support W Avyâ€™s decision to open the shop or not depending on the weather results. Better weather means better business. For this analysis SQL specifically, SQLite and SQLalchemy, and Python were tools for finding and analyzing Hawaii weather statistics.
